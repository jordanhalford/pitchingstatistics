Here is my first Microsoft Excel project. In this project, I wanted to take a look at how many pitches
were thrown at each velocity by pitchers who had pitched for the Pittsburgh Pirates, starting back in
2020. With help from http://www.baseball-reference.com/ I got an extensive list of pitchers who had
pitched for the team. With this list, I went to https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search/ to get
the data to analyze. I compiled all of the data from CSV files into a single Excel worksheet. I then
added an extra column to the table, which would round the release speed for each pitch that was thrown.
I then made a pivot taable, which included the pitcher, season, pitch type, and the rounded velocity of
each pitch that was thrown. I used that pivot table to make a very detailed table in a new Excel file, 
documenting every pitch, making sure that each pitch contained details for the four categories listed
above. I created a number of new pivot tables to use for my final dashboard for the project. These
included pitch type and velocity vs the number of pitches, both below 500 and above 500 pitches, as
well as pitcher vs number of pitches, and pitch type vs number of time that pitch was thrown. I then
made charts for the tables, put those charts into the dashboad, color coded them so that they would be
consistent with one another, and made three different slicers, for pitch type, season, and pitcher. All
three slicers ontrol all aspects of the dashboard for ease of analysis.
